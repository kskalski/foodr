## Background ##

Foodr was created to ease organization of food orders and automate notifications for all participants. In a busy corporation, people often doesn't have time or interest in lurking throughout the city in a search for food. They also doesn't like to stay hungry till the end of workday. So the more or less spontaneous actions are undertaken by members of a hungry team to call for pizza or some other meal. This results in chaos, as they have no reliable and non-intrusive (no more food spam) way to coordinate their effort. And then comes Foodr.
